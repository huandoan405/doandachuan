Mercedes-Benz is in advanced negotiations to use BMW's 4-cylinder gasoline engines for many next-generation vehicle lines, as the German automaker needs to adjust its internal combustion engine (ICE) strategy due to disappointing electric vehicle (EV) sales.An internal source from Mercedes-Benz said the group and BMW have entered planning and negotiation processes at a high level. A final decision is expected to be announced this year. The German magazine Manager Magazin was the first to reveal this information.If approved, BMW will supply a new generation of gasoline engines for Mercedes-Benz models ranging from CLA, GLA, GLB, C-Class, E-Class, GLC to the completely new &quot;mini G-Class&quot; SUV.
